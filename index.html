            <h2>Observation is relative.</h2>
            <p>We all know that different people can perceive a situation is different ways. This concept can be applied to physics as well.

                    <button>e.g. The Train Station</button>
                    <p class="ex"> Imagine two people; one is standing on the platform of a train station and another on a train moving past it. The stationary person on the platform sees the train moving past them rapidly, but to the person on the train, it is the person on the platform that is moving.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>This phenomenon is best demonstrated when objects approach the speed of light. When objects move this rapidly, some seriously weird stuff starts to happen. This is explained by relativity, a theory developed by Albert Einstein in the early twentieth century. </p>

        <div class="text">
            <h2>Relativity is built on two core postulates.</h2>

            <p class="emphasis">
                1: Equivalence of Physical Laws
            </p>
            <p>The laws of physics are the same in all internal frames of reference.</p>
            <p class="emphasis">2: Constancy of the Speed of Light</p>
            <p>The speed of light in a vacuum, c = 3.00 x 10<sup>8</sup> m/s, is the same in all internal frames of reference, regardless of the motion of the source or the observer of the light.</p>
