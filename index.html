            <p>We all know that different people can perceive a situation is different ways. This concept can be applied to physics as well.

                    <p class="ex"> Imagine two people; one is standing on the platform of a train station and another on a train moving past it. The stationary person on the platform sees the train moving past them rapidly, but to the person on the train, it is the person on the platform that is moving.

                <p>This phenomenon is best demonstrated when objects approach the speed of light. When objects move this rapidly, some seriously weird stuff starts to happen. This is explained by relativity, a theory developed by Albert Einstein in the early twentieth century. </p>

            <h2>Equivalence of Physical Laws</h2>
            <p>In an <span class="emphasis">internal frame of reference</span>, Newton’s laws of motion are obeyed. Einstein’s first postulate basically states that internal frames of reference exist not only for Newton’s laws, but for all known laws of physics.

                <p class="ex">Imagine you roll a cannonball and a marble across a horizontal surface on Earth. If they have the same initial velocity, the two objects will roll at exactly the same rate. Now image you take the same objects and fly to any other part of the universe. As long as both experiments are performed within internal frames of reference (that is, with no acceleration), the rolling objects will behave the same way.</p>
