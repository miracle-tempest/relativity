Even if we could build generation starships, human society could drastically change in the thousands of years it would take us to arrive at our destination.

            <p>This is where the weird stuff comes in. Because nothing can exceed the speed of light, the rules of time and space must bend to accommodate objects moving close to that speed. It may sound like something out of <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/1000/1.html" target="_blank" class="ov-link"><i>The Time Machine</i></a>, but just as movement through space is relative, so is movement through time.</p>

                <p class="ex">Imagine riding due north on a motorcycle that can travel at 100 km / hr. All your motion is directed northward, but then, you decide to turn slightly west. Your speed is still 100 km / hr, but your velocity has changed. Because some of your motion is westward, you’re not moving north as quickly as you were before. This is analogous to movement through time and space.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>When an object is at rest, all its motion is devoted to moving through time, but as soon as it gains velocity, some of its motion is occupied moving through space. Thus, a moving object cannot move through time as quickly as an object at rest. This is the basis on Einstein's theory of special relativity. In fact:

        <!-- Time Dilation -->
        <div class="text">
            <h2>Time Dilation</h2>

            <p>Though it may seem impossible, time acts more slowly on objects moving at very high speeds than it does on objects at rest. This phenomenon is called time dilation, and it can be calculated using the formula below.</p>
            <p class="eq">&Delta;<i>t</i> = &Delta;<i>t</i><sub>0</sub> / &radic;<span class="overline"> 1 - (<i>v</i><sup>2</sup> / c<sup>2</sup>)</span></p>
            <p class="eqex">Dilated time interval = proper time / &radic;<span class="overline"> 1 - ((speed of clock)<sup>2</sup> / (speed of light<sup>2</sup>))</span></p>

                <p class=" ex">
                    Time dilation can be demonstrated with the use of a light clock: a clock for which one interval of time (a “tick”) is the time it takes for light to travel from its source to a mirror and be reflected back to a sensor. When the clock is at rest, this is called the proper time. In this case, the light must travel exactly twice the distance from the source to the mirror. When it is moving, however, it must travel a greater distance, thus taking a longer time.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="hidden">

                <p class="ex">Imagine two identical clocks, both reading exactly the same time. One is kept on Earth, while another is sent across the galaxy on a spaceship moving close to the speed of light. Though the clocks were synchronized before, the clock on the spaceship will begin to tick more slowly than the stationary one as the spaceship approaches the speed of light.</p>

            <div class="hidden">
                <button class="ov-cont"><i class="ico ico-lightbulb"></i> The Effects of Time Dilation</button>

                <p class="ex">Clocks aren’t the only things affected by time dilation. Time itself slows down for objects in motion. Chemical reactions and biological processes are affected by this just as much as the light clock. Astronauts traveling on a nearly lightspeed spaceship would not notice any change, however, as even their thought processes would slow down. To them, only a few seconds would seem to pass in a hundred Earth years.</p>

            <div class="hidden">

                <p class="ex">Since humans can only reach a fraction of the speed of light, the effect of time dilation on us is miniscule. An astronaut would have to travel for hundreds of years at the fastest speed attainable by modern technology for their clock to deviate even a second from the proper time.

Just as time slows at velocities close to the speed of light, distance approaches zero; as velocity increases, length becomes smaller. This is illustrated in the equation below.</p>

            <h2>The Equivalence of Matter and Energy</h2>
            <p>So far, we've mostly studied how time and space change at very high speeds. However, matter (that which has mass and takes up space) and energy (that which can be transferred from one object or another but can never be created or destroyed) also play a key role in relativity. At first, it seems like matter and energy are entirely different. However, Einstein’s most famous equation shows that they are equivalent.
            </p>
            <p class="eq"><i>E</i> = <i>m</i>c<sup>2</sup></p>
            <p class="eqex">Rest energy = (mass of object) x (speed of light)<sup>2</sup></p>
            <p class="emph">Matter and energy are different forms of the same thing.</p>

                <p class="ex">Mass can be converted to energy by harnessing nuclear power. In a nuclear reactor, atoms (like uranium-235) fission (break apart) into two smaller nuclei (and some neutrons left over). However, the combined mass of these smaller particles is less than the original atom, so excess energy is released. This can produce an incredible amount of energy, which people can use to power entire cities.

        </div>
        <div class="text">
            <h2>Mass Changes With Velocity</h2>
            <p><i>E</i> = <i>m</i>c<sup>2</sup> gives the energy of an object at rest. However, like time and distance, mass is affected by velocity. This can be demonstrated with the equation shown below.</p>

            <p class="eq"><i>E</i> = (<i>m</i><sub>0</sub>c<sup>2</sup>) / &radic;<span class="overline"> 1 - (<i>v</i><sup>2</sup> / c<sup>2</sup>)</span></p>

            <p>Because of the immense magnitude of the speed of light, even an object with a relatively small mass will have an enormous amount of relativistic energy.

        <div class="text">
            <h2>Matter and Antimatter</h2>
            <p>Interestingly, matter is not the only thing that has mass. For every particle of matter, there is a corresponding particle of antimatter. Antimatter has the same mass as matter, but the opposite charge. For example, a hydrogen atom has a nucleus with one proton and one neutron and is orbited by a single electron; an antihydrogen atom has a nucleus with one antiproton and one antineutron and is orbited by a single positron.

                <p class="ex">Antimatter can be created in particle accelerators like the Large Hadron Collider, where particles can be accelerated to speeds close to the speed of light. In fact, whole antiatoms have been created, which suggested the possibility of entire galaxies and life forms made of antimatter.</p>

                <p class="ex">Antimatter is fascinating because of how it interacts with matter: they annihilate one another. When matter touches antimatter, both particles' mass is converted into pure energy in the form of gamma rays. This release of energy can be enormously violent; even a gram of antimatter interacting with an equal amount of matter could produce an explosion large enough to devastate an entire country.

                <p class="ex"> Many works of science fiction explore the tactical implications of antimatter's destructive tendencies, but the cost of producing antimatter is so prohibitive and its nature so dangerous that no real army has yet created an antimatter weapon.

                <p class="ex">Before Einstein published his theories, space and time were conventionally regarded as entirely separate. Space was thought to exist in three dimensions (length, breadth, and width), while time inhabited a fourth dimension. Because space and time are so intertwined, however, the two can combined into a single continuum called <i>spacetime</i>.</p>

            <p>Just as objects with significant gravitational fields draw smaller objects towards them, gravity affects spacetime. Imagine spacetime as an infinitely large sheet of rubber marked with a grid pattern. When there is no mass present, the fabric of spacetime is flat and the pattern unchanged. However, as soon as mass is added, the rubber stretches and the pattern is distorted.</p>

            <p>When there is no acceleration, light travels in a straight line, directly from its source. However, gravity bends the path of light just as it bends spacetime. In fact, light's path around very massive objects can be seen to be parabolic.</p>

By analyzing the pictures, it became clear that the stars appeared to be in different positions because of the way the Sun's gravity bent their light.

                <p class="ex">When a star consumes all its nuclear energy, it undergoes a supernova and collapses into a relatively small, very massive object. When this object's gravitational field is so strong that light cannot escape it, it is called a black hole. Black holes cannot be directly observed, but their existence is measurable by how they distort the images of surrounding celestial objects. Because of their enormous gravity, it is thought that black holes exist at the center of many galaxies, including ours. It’s best never to venture near a black hole, though; their gravity is so strong that it rips objects apart in a process called spaghettification (seriously).

            <h2>Causality</h2>
            <p>Relativity raises many philisophical dilemnas about the nature of existence. For example, if the universe has no objectively "correct" chronology, do we control our own destiny? If all moments of time exist simultaneously, do we have free will? We're used to thinking of time as catalyzing the progression of events, but in reality, it does not. Rather, causality is what links everything together.</p>
            <p>That is, If Event B follows Event A, it doesn't do so because Event A comes first chronologically--there is no objective timeline along which it can follow. Rather, Event A <i>causes</i> Event B to occur. It is causality that links the two, not proximity in time.</p>

            <h2>So What?</h2>
            <p>Relativity affects everything in the universe, from apples falling from trees to the ceaseless wandering of distant galaxies. Its interdisciplinary applications in fields as diverse as mathematics and philosophy raise existential questions that force us to reassess not only the nature of humanity, but the nature of the universe as a whole. Alongside quantum mechanics, relativity is a pillar of modern physics; the more we study it, the more it pushes the boundaries of human reasoning, and the closer we get to understanding our whimsical, wonderful, fantastical universe.
