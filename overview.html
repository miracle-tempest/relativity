            <h2>Observation is Relative</h2>
            <p>We all know that different people can perceive a situation is different ways. This concept can be applied to physics as well.

                    <p class="ex"> Imagine two people; one is standing on the platform of a train station and another on a train moving past it. The stationary person sees the train rapidly moving past them, but to the person on the train, it is the person on the platform that is moving.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <p>This phenomenon is best illustrated at velocities close to the speed of light. When objects move this rapidly, some seriously weird stuff starts to happen. This is explained by relativity, a theory developed in the early twentieth century by Albert Einstein in response to the inability of Newtonian mechanics to adaquately describe objects' behavior at extremely high speeds.</p>

            <h2>Equivalence of Physical Laws</h2>

                <p class="ex">Imagine you roll a cannonball and a marble across a horizontal surface on Earth. If they have the same initial velocity, the two objects will roll at exactly the same rate. Now imagine you take the same objects and fly to a planet on the other side of the galaxy. As long as both experiments are performed within internal frames of reference, the rolling objects will behave the same way.</p>

            <p>As long as an experiment is performed within an intertial frame of reference, it can be performed anywhere in the universe with the same result.</p>

                c &cong; 2.99792458 x 10<sup>8</sup> m / s
            </p>
            <p>Even if a light source or its observer is moving, the speed of light is constant; it never changes, and no known object can exceed it.</p>
            <div class="hidden">
                <button class="ov-cont"><i class="ico ico-lightbulb"></i> The Fastest Speed in the Universe</button>
                <p class="ex"> 3.00 x 10<sup>8</sup> m / s may seem unimaginably fast, but actually, the speed of light is cripplingly slow. Because of the immense size of the universe and the upper bound the speed of light sets on how fast we can move, intersteller travel is a logisic impossibility for us. Even if we could be build generation starships, human society could drastically change in the thousands of years it would take us to arrive at our destination. Even within our own solar system, traveling from one celestial object to another takes a riddiculously long time.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Because it takes so long for light from distant stars to reach Earth, every time we look into the night sky, we see the stars as they were thousands of years ago. Some of those stars underwent supernova long ago, but since their light began travelling before they collapsed, our night sky is peppered with the ghosts of long dead stars.</p>

            <h2>Inertial Observers</h2>
            <p>All inertial observers measure the speed of light as the same, constant value, and thus, they can all argue that they are at rest and everything else is moving around them. There is no absolute motion or stillness; all motion is relative to something else in the universe.</p>
            <p>Refer again to our thought experiment about the train station. In this situation, both the person on the train and the person on the platform are equally correct in claiming at they are at rest. This can be calculated using the equation below.</p>

        <div class="text">
            <h2>Time Dilation</h2>
            <p>This is where the weird stuff comes in. Because nothing can exceed the speed of light, the rules of time and space must bend to accomodate objects moving close to that speed.</p>
            <p>Though it may seem impossible, <span class="emphasis">time acts more slowly on objects moving at very high speeds than it does on objects at rest.</span></p>
            <p class="eq">&Delta;<i>t</i> = &Delta;<i>t</i><sub>0</sub> / &radic;<span class="overline"> 1 - (<i>v</i><sup>2</sup> / c<sup>2</sup>)</span></p>
            <p class="eqex">Dilated time interval = proper time / &radic;<span class="overline"> 1 - ((speed of clock)<sup>2</sup> / (speed of light<sup>2</sup>))</span></p>
            <div class="hidden">
                <button class="ov-cont"><i class="ico ico-key"></i> Demonstrating Time Dilation with Light Clocks</button>
                <p class=" ex">
                    Time dilation can be demonstrated with the use of a light clock: a clock for which one interval of time (a “tick”) is the time it takes for light to travel from its source to a mirror and be reflected back to a sensor. When the clock is at rest, this is called the proper time. In this case, the light must travel exactly twice the distance from the source to the mirror. When it is moving, however, it must travel a greater distance, thus taking a longer time.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Imagine two identical clocks, both reading exactly the same time. One is kept on Earth, while another is sent across the galaxy on a spaceship moving close to the speed of light. Though the clocks were synchronized before, the clock on the spaceship will begin to tick more slowly than the stationary one as the spaceship approaches the speed of light.</p>
            <p>Clock aren’t the only things affected by time dilation, though. Time itself slows down for objects in motion. Chemical reactions and biological processes are affected by this just as much as the light clock. Astronauts traveling on a nearly lightspeed spaceship would not notice any change, however, as even their thought processess would slow down. To them, only a few seconds would seem to pass in a hundred Earth years.</p>
            <p>However, since humans can only reach a fraction of the speed of light, the effect of time dilation on us is miniscule. An astronaut would have to travel for hundreds of years at the fastest speed attainable by modern technology for their clock to deviate even a second from the proper time.

            <h2>Length Contraction</h2>
            <p>Time isn’t the only thing affected when velocity approaches the speed of light, however. At very high speeds, distances also changes.
            </p>
            <p>Just as time slows at velocities close to the speed of light, distance approaches zero; as velocity increases, length becomes smaller.</p>

            <h2>The Equivalence of Matter and Energy</h2>
            <p>At first, it seems like matter and energy are entirely different. However, Einstein’s most famous equation shows that they are equivalent.</p>
            <p class="eq"><i>E</i> = <i>m</i>c<sup>2</sup></p>
            <p class="eqex">Rest energy = (mass of object) x (speed of light)<sup>2</sup></p>
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            <h2>Mass Changes With Velocity</h2>
            <p><i>E</i> = <i>m</i>c<sup>2</sup> gives the energy of an object at rest. However, like time and distance, mass is affected by velocity. This can be demonstrated with the equation shown below.</p>

            <p class="eq"><i>E</i> = (<i>m</i><sub>0</sub>c<sup>2</sup>) / &radic;<span class="overline"> 1 - (<i>v</i><sup>2</sup> / c<sup>2</sup>)</span></p>
            <p class="eqex">Relativistic energy = (rest mass) x (speed of light)<sup>2</sup> / &radic; 1 - ((speed of object)<sup>2</sup> / (speed of light)<sup>2</sup>)</p>

            <p>Because of the immense magnitude of the speed of light, even an object with a relativly small mass will have an enourmous amount of relativistic energy.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            <h2>Converting Mass to Energy</h2>
            <p>Mass can be converted to energy by harnessing nuclear power. In a nuclear reactor, atoms (like uranium-235) fission (break apart) into two smaller nuclei (and some neutrons left over). However, the combined mass of these smaller particles is less than the original atom, so excess energy is released. This can produce an incredible amount of energy which people can use to power entire cities.
