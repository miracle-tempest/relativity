            <p>We all know that different people can perceive a situation is different ways. This concept can be applied to physics as well.

                <p>This phenomenon is best demonstrated when objects approach the speed of light. When objects move this rapidly, some seriously weird stuff starts to happen. This is explained by relativity, a theory developed by Albert Einstein in the early twentieth century. </p>

                <p class="ex">Imagine you roll a cannonball and a marble across a horizontal surface on Earth. If they have the same initial velocity, the two objects will roll at exactly the same rate. Now imagine you take the same objects and fly to any other part of the universe. As long as both experiments are performed within internal frames of reference (that is, with no acceleration), the rolling objects will behave the same way.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Light always travels at a constant speed. Even if its source or an observer of the light is moving, the speed of light never changes. <span class="emphasis">Ever.</span></p>

            <p>This may seem unimaginably fast, but actually, the speed of light is incredibly slow. Because of the immense size of the universe and the upper bound the speed of light sets on how fast we can travel, intersteller travel is a logisic impossibility for us. Even if we could be build generation starships, human society could drastically change in the thousands of years it would take us to arrive at our destination. Even within our own solar system, traveling from one celestial object to another takes a riddiculously long time.</p>

                <button><i class="ico ico-lightbulb"></i> Calculate: The Speed of Light Delay Between the Sun and the Earth</button>
                <p class="ex">The Sun is about 149.8 billion meters from Earth. In scientific notation, that’s about 1.498 x 10<sup>11</sup> m. Dividing this by the speed of light is m/s, we can calculate the speed of light delay between the two.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>Because it takes so long for light from distant stars to reach Earth, every time we look into the night sky, we see the stars as they were thousands of years ago. Some of those stars underwent supernova long ago, but since the light we see began travelling before they collapsed, our night sky is peppered with the ghosts of long dead stars.</p>
            <h2>All inertial observers can be considered at rest.</h2>
            <p>All inertial observers measure the speed of light as the same, constant value, and thus, they can all argue that they are at rest and everything else is moving around them. There is no absolute motion or stillness; <span class="emphasis">all motion is relative to something else in the universe</span>.</p>
            <p>Refer again to our <a href="#trainstation">thought experiment</a> about the train station. In this situation, both the person on the train and the person on the platform are equally correct in claiming at <i>they</i> are at rest.</p>

                <button><i class="ico ico-lightbulb"></i> Thought Experiment: Chasing a Light Beam</button>
                <p class="ex">Imagine riding on a train that can match the speed of light. What would happen if you turn on the headlights? Now imagine you can move even faster, exceeding the speed of light. What happens now if you turn on the headlights? No one knows.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>This is where the weird stuff comes in. Because nothing can exceed the speed of light, the rules of time and space must bend to accomodate objects moving close to that speed.</p>

        <!--Time and Length-->
        <div class="text">
            <h2>Time Dialation</h2>
            <p>Though it may seem impossible, <span class="emphasis">time acts more slowly on objects moving at very high speeds than it does on objects at rest.</span></p>

            <img src="Sinon.png" alt="Equation for Time Dialation">
            <p>
                Time dilation can be demonstrated with the use of a <span class="emphasis">light clock</span>: a clock where one interval of time (a “tick”) is the time it takes for light to travel from its source, bounce off a mirror, and be detected by a sensor. This is called the "<span class="emphasis">proper time</span>." When the clock is at rest, the light must travel exactly twice the distance from the source to the mirror, but when it is moving, it must travel a greater distance, thus taking a longer time.</p>



            <div class="hidden">
                <button><i class="ico ico-lightbulb"></i> (Nearly) Light Speed Spaceship</button>
                <p class="ex">Imagine two identical clocks, both reading exactly the same time. One is kept on Earth, while another is sent across the galaxy on a spaceship moving close to the speed of light. Though the clocks were synchronized before, the clock on the spaceship will begin to tick more slowly than the stationary one as the spaceship approaches the speed of light.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Clock aren’t the only things affected by time dilation, though. Time itself slows down for objects in motion. Chemical reactions and biological processes are affected by this just as much as the light clock.
            </p>

            <div class="hidden">
                <button><i class="ico ico-lightbulb"></i> Though Experiment: Aging</button>
                <p class="ex">Imagine someone traveling on a starship moving close to the speed of light. This person’s every biological function, even their thoughts, would slow down while they maintain this velocity. Thus, they would age more slowly than people back on Earth, but they wouldn’t notice any change. To them, it could feel as if only a few minutes had passed, while hundreds of Earth years had gone by.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>However, since humans can only reach a fraction of the speed of light, the effect of time dilation on us is miniscule. An astronaut would have to travel for hundreds of years at the fastest speed attainable by modern technology for their clock to deviate even a second from the proper time.
            </p>

        <div class="text">
            <h2>Length Contraction</h2>
            <p>Time isn’t the only thing affected when velocity approaches the speed of light, however. At very high speeds, distances also changes.
            </p>
            <p>Just as time slows at velocities close to the speed of light, distance approaches zero. The length of any object when it is at rest is called its proper length. As velocity increases, length becomes smaller.
